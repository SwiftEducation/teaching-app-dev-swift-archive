# How to Contribute

## Post an Issue

If you discover a bug or error, please [add an issue](https://github.com/SwiftEducation/teaching-app-dev-swift/issues) here on GitHub. Feature requests are welcome. However, this is a community effort, so pull requests are preferred.

## Create a Pull Request

Fork the project, create a branch, commit your changes, and then create a pull request. Please submit your pull request to the **develop** branch of this repository.

The **master** branch is for production-ready content and should not contain incomplete lessons. Development occurs on the **develop** branch. Once your pull request is accepted, it will be merged into **master**.

## Impacts to Xcode Projects

Please note that, because the lesson plans correspond with code in the various Xcode projects, you will likely need to submit an issue and/or pull request in the relevant repository for that Xcode project. [A full list of the Xcode project repositories can be seen here](http://github.com/SwiftEducation).

## Creating New Lessons

Please use the [Lesson Plan template](https://github.com/SwiftEducation/teaching-app-dev-swift/raw/master/Templates/Lesson%20Plan.template) to generate any lesson plans, so our work stays consistent. If you have an _entirely new_ app/project idea with accompanying lesson plans, please [post an issue](https://github.com/SwiftEducation/teaching-app-dev-swift/issues) or create a pull request.
